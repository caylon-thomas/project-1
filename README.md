Mindy
To fully understand the dataset from https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data, would like to plot out a couple of graphs to see the following: 
•	Average trip duration, shortest trip, longest trip – stuff like that
•	Day time peaks of usership. i.e. mornings, evenings
•	Usership location. Would this be helpful for businesses? 
•	Are certain bikes used more than other? 
•	Breaking out member type. (Annual Member, 30-Day Member or Day Key Member) or a "casual" rider (Single Trip, 24-Hour Pass, 3-Day Pass or 5-Day Pass)

Has bicycle related accidents in Washington DC increased with the introduction of bike share?
Is there a trend? 
Comparing dataset from http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/crashes-in-dc and https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data

What is the probability of increased scooter/bicycle incidents vs a decrease of vehicle incidents. If the purpose of bike/scooter share is to provide an alternative to public transportation/personal vehicles there by decreasing congestion and pollution. 

Is there a noticeable decrease in bike share usership since the introduction of lime and byrd scooters?
